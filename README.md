## Overview

The Hotel Management Application is a Spring Boot-based system designed to manage hotel room data efficiently. It provides a set of RESTful API endpoints for tasks such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting room records. This application offers features for room type filtering, price updates, and availability tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Database:** MySQL

## Project Summary

The Hotel Management Application is a Spring Boot-based system designed for efficient room data management. It offers a set of RESTful API endpoints for various room-related operations, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting room records.

### Key Technologies Used

- **Framework:** Spring Boot
- **Language:** Java
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Database:** MySQL

#### Controller

The Controller layer handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate services. It defines API endpoints for operations such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting room records.

#### Services

The Services layer implements core business logic and data processing, including input validation, CRUD operations on room data, and handling price updates and availability tracking.

#### Repository

The Repository layer manages data access to the embedded H2 database, performing Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for room data.

### Key Features

- RESTful API endpoints for room management.
- Data validation to ensure data integrity.
- Clean code separation with a layered architecture (Controller, Services, Repository).
- Efficient data storage and retrieval using MySQL database.

The Hotel Management Application serves as a practical example of Spring Boot application development, demonstrating best practices in API design and room data management. It offers a solid foundation for building and extending hotel management systems in various applications.
